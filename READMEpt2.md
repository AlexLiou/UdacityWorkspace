# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This is the final project for the Udacity's Nanodegree React Fundamentals course.

The goal of the MyReads project was to create a web book management app that could search, select, and categorize books into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Have Read. 

React components were created to provide book management between the user's current library and search results. This allows a user to move books to and from each categories while also syncing with backend API calls. 

The BrowserRouter component was implemented to provide unique URLs for separate web pages and track page history. 

Because the backend API uses a fix set of cached search results and is limited to a certain set of search terms (found within the SEARCH_TERMS.md file) means the the search engine will only response to those search terms.
